1) var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3000');
app.set('port', port); Has been removed from bin/www file leaving to port for app undefined line 15. 



2) var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser'); has been removed from app.js file line 4. 




3) package.json has been removed from project: {
  "name": "graduate-project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "jade": "~1.11.0",
    "morgan": "~1.9.1"
  }
}

The package.json file is kind of a manifest for your project. It can do a lot of things, completely unrelated. It's a central repository of configuration for tools, for example. It's also where npm and yarn store the names and versions for all the installed packages.

4) app.use('/', indexRouter); missing from app.js line 22. Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.

You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function (See Using middleware for details).

5) link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css') removed from layout.jade line 5 disconnecting from style sheets. 

6) extends layout removed from Pug/jade template. line 1 index.jade. Pug supports template inheritance. Template inheritance works via the block and extends keywords.

In a template, a block is simply a “block” of Pug that a child template may replace. This process is recursive.

Pug blocks can provide default content, if appropriate. Providing default content is purely optional, though. The example below defines block scripts, block content, and block foot.
